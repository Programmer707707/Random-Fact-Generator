# Random Fact Generator

This is a simple React-based single-page application (SPA) created using Vite, which allows users to fetch interesting facts about numbers. The application fetches data from the Numbers API, providing trivia, math facts, and more about any number entered by the user. You can also generate random facts!

## Technology Stack
- **React**: For building the UI.
- **Vite**: For fast project setup and hot module replacement.
- **CSS**: For custom styling.
- **Material UI**: For modern and responsive UI components.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to fetch number facts.
